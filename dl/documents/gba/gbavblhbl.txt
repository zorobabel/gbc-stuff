Gameboy Advance V-Blank and H-Blank cycles
written by Matt D.

I have calculated that H-Blank takes 272 cycles and V-Blank takes 
83799 cycles.  Its based on these stats:
 	* CPU is 16.78 MHz
	* H-Blank takes 16.212 us
	* V-Blank takes 4.994 us
 
Given that the thumb and ARM instruction sets are RISC instructions, 
those cycles should translate into instructions.
