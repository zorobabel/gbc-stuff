Gameboy Advance Display Overview
Written by Matt D.

Sprite size up to 64x64, 128 sprites maximum (subject to VRAM 
restrictions and other things), tile map size up to 1024x1024 pixels 
(depending on video mode), 16 alpha blend levels, sprites can be 
16-colour or 256-colour again depending on the mode.
You can use any multiple of 8 up to 64 in both width and height.
The limit is 128 sprites and 128 8x8 sprites per scanline.  Which 
means you can only have 16 64 pixel sprites per scan-line which is 
still lots better than the GBC.  When you add rotate and zoom it can 
cut into your H-blank time if you want but bear in mind that it can 
restrict the max number of sprites you have because of extra 
processing.  

There are 3 character modes and 3 bitmapped modes.  There is 96K 
of VRAM.

There are two colour modes. 16 colours on 16 palettes or 256 colours 
on 1 palette.  You have seperate OBJ and BG palettes.

Tile size for tile maps dependent on the mode.  There are 3 tiled 
modes and 3 bitmapped modes. Screen sizes range from 128x128 to 
1024x1024 pixels.

You can have up to 4 BG tilemaps at anyone time, each with there own 
rotation, zoom, alpha and scroll settings.  Of course each takes up 
their own amount of VRAM (which is 96K - still more than SNES) so use 
of 4 BGs can fill up the space. On some modes you can have double 
buffering.


Tile maps be layered on top of sprites. There levels are thus:

BACK
1.      Background
2.      BG priority 0
3.      Sprite priority 0
4.      BG priority 1
5.      Sprite priority 1
6.      BG priority 2
7.      Sprite priority 2
8.      BG priority 3
9.      Sprite priority 3
FRONT

The background is just colour 0 of palette 0.

DMA interrupts are useful for filling in the FIFO buffers for sound 
or any other code that needs to stream information, say, from 
external to internalRAM. I have not found any information regarding 
DMA transfer speed but I wouldn't be surprised if it was keyed into 
the clock speed (16.78 MHz).  The 4 DMAs have different priorities, 
so one is interrupted when a higher priority is started.
I cannot tell you either if the CPU stops during DMA transfer, but I 
hope not.  The CGB DMA didn't halt the CPU did it?  Doesn't the 
standard OAM transfer routine executes a minimum loop for 140 times 
while it waits for DMA to be over?
