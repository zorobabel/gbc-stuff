MegaMem Powerup Logo

After reading on this list a couple weeks ago that the MegaMem cartridge
boots up with it's own logo ("MegaMem") and still works on a GBC, I just had
to get one.

Since I don't have a logic analyzer - I had to use the next best thing - a
GB.

Here's a program I wrote to help me figure out what happens when power is
applied to the MegaMem cart.

(description in the source code)
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! This program copies program code and places it in ram
then "stops". You then have to pull out your flash cart, push any button,
and finally insert the MegaMem cart. I have tried this with a homemade
cartridge (AMD29F040) but not with a bung cart (I don't have one to try) USE
AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Here's how it boots up (as far as I can tell!)
On power up (of MegaMem cart)
"Nintendo" logo is present for 16 msec
"MegaMem"  logo is present for 183 msec
"Nintendo" logo is present for 83 msec
"MegaMem"  logo is present for 484 msec
"Nintendo" logo is present forever

These values are not precise (they are muliples of 16.7msec)
I have assumed a few things - I'm only reading location $0104, not sampling
faster than every 16msec - so let me know if there is more to this powerup
logo!

I was a little off on my timing. I was able to measure what the MegaMem cart
was doing on startup using a demo version of a PC parallel logic analyzer

The MegaMem cart has an 8 pin microcontroller (PIC12C508A) that toggles the
memory bank a couple of times on power up.

I have been able to do the same thing and boot up with a custom logo on both
a pocket gb AND a color gb.

Here's the timing that I got to work

powerup with "Nintendo"
"Nintendo" logo present for 19.2ms after reset
Custom logo present for 89.6ms
"Nintendo" logo present for 46.4ms
Custom logo present for 262.7ms
"Nintendo" logo present forever
