Music Systems Resource Overview
by Justin Bailey <justinbailey28@hotmail.com>

I was doing a little research on all the GB music systems to see how 
powerful they are and how much resources they take up.  Here is what I came 
up with by hacking a few roms etc..  This is at 2mhz GBC..  
Feedback/corrections are appreciated.  Also, any stats on RAM usage would be 
cool!

Audio Arts:
7 scanline constant low
12 scanlines peak

Laxity:
4 scanlines constant low
6 scanlines peak

Musyx:
3 scanlines constant low
15 scanlines peak

Paragon 5:
1 scanline constant low
5 scanlines peak

Shinen:
3 scanlines constant low
9 scanlines peak
