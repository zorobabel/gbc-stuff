Game Shark Codes Format
Written by GeeBee

 AABBCCDD...
 AA=code type
 BB=Value to be inserted into address
 CCDD=address to be used (CC=low byte DD=high byte)
 for all code 'before' Action Replay 2 (game shark 2) you could
 only have codes in the internal ram area of the gameboy.
 The code type was not used by the code system.. the values inserted here
 from the original version told Datel what type of trainer had been used
 to find the cheat code.


 Now the code type is used to mark the correct EXTERNAL ram page.
 (I think) the code should be 80, 81, 82 and 83 this is for the
 four pages of the external ram. (a000-bfff).
