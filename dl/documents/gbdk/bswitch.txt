You can switch ROM banks from a ROM other than 0, but unless you 
really know what your doing, you should never do it.  What will 
happen is the code will be switched out from under the program.  
So, the program will be running along it bank 2.  Then it switches 
to bank 3.  Since the program counter (how the CPU keeps track of 
where in the program you are) will point to a location that now 
refers to bank 3, code in bank 3 will be run, not the routine you 
were in from bank 2.  This is generally a very bad thing.  Imagaine 
it like this.  You're reading a book.  Suddenly, the sentence you're 
reading makes the pages turn (it's a magic book), but you keep 
reading from the same place on the page.  What you're reading won't 
make any sense, and you'll get confused, and (if you're a computer) 
crash horribly.

What I'd advise you to do is create a small function in bank 0 that 
takes three parameters: a pointer to the function to run, the 
bank number of the function, and the bank number to return to 
when done.  So instead of 

>  SWITCH_ROM_MBC1(3);
>  whatever();
>  SWITCH_ROM_MBC1(2);

You'd use:

> Call_Far(whatever,3,2);

where Call_Far is a funciton you've created in bank 0.

The best way to accomplish this would probably be to copy the data 
from ROM to RAM, that way you can ascess it from any ROM bank.
