How to remove a function from a VBL interrupt in GBDK

I noticed Quang was interested in this too, so here's a method I was 
sent for removing functions from a VBL interrupt in GBDK.

GBDK does not support remove functions; we wrote them ourselves. Add 
this to the crt0.s in the lib directory:


_remove_VBL::
 PUSH BC
 LDA HL,4(SP) ; Skip return address and registers
 LD C,(HL)
 INC HL
 LD B,(HL)
 LD HL,#.int_0x40
 CALL .remove_int
 POP BC
 RET



Course you need to rebuild the lib!!

After putting the asm in and rebuilding the lib, I also added the 
following line to gb.h under the Interrupt Handlers section :


void
remove_VBL(int_handler h);



GeeBee mentioned an alternative method that would also work :


<---------------------------------


Rather than remove it you could just enable/disable it if that
works for you.


 if (VBLEnabled)
    {
    }
