I've managed to identify the following commercial games written in GBDK


Game                 Publisher
----------------------------------------------
Logical              Sunsoft/THQ
Mahjong King (J)     Cobra Team
Meta Mode (J)        Koei
Pro Darts            Vatical Entertainment
Qix Adventure (J)    Taito
Sweet Ange (J)       Koei
----------------------------------------------


If anybody know's of any other commercial GBDK games that have been
released,
it would be intersting to here which.


Meta Mode seems to be a nice little RPG, shame it's all in japanese.
Qix Adventure uses a simple APA map, and isn't slow.
Interesting to see that 4 of the games are Japanese. But as for the quality
of
the gameplay / graphics / sound of all the games, it's all very suspect.
