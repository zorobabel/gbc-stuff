                First, you need to get an Assembly Language (ASM) compiler (often also referred
                to as an assembler) or GBDK compiler if you wish to program in C language
                instead of ASM.<br>
                <br>
                Next, if you are programming in ASM you need to get a conversion program
                that will convert the output of the assembler into a format that is useable
                by the GB. (<a href="#ImportantWebLinks">RGBFIX</a> is a popular DOS program
                that many use to do this conversion.) A conversion program does such things
                as fix the ROM checksums &amp; pad the ROM file to a correct size.<br>
                <br>
                To test your program you will either need a <a href="#Emulator">gb emulator</a>
                or a <a href="#FlashCart">flash cart.</a><br>
                <br>

                <br>
                Theoretically you can use a <a href="#Emulator">gb emulator</a> for development
                and not require any hardware. The reality though is that no emulator is 100%
                like the real GB hardware and emulators will often run code that real hardware
                will not.<br>
                <br>
                To guarantee that your code will run on real GB hardware you need to put
                your code into a GB cart and try it on the real GB handheld unit. To do this
                you can wire an EPROM into a GB cart (yourself) or buy or build a
                <a href="#FlashCart">flash cart</a>. EPROM's require an ultraviolet light
                source to erase them so flash carts are often a simpler
                solution.<br>
                <br>
                Another method that some use is to connect an <a href="#Emulator">EPROM
                emulator</a> to a GB cart. <br>

                Assembly language is what the majority of commercial GB games use. One reason
                for this is that no serious C compiler has been available for the GB until
                GBDK was released. Another reason is that C is terribly inefficient. A C
                compiler can often generate 8 to 10 times more code compared to optimized
                assembly code. As GB ROM cart sizes get larger this makes less of a difference
                unless you are talking about ROM bank 0. ROM bank 0 is a major bottle neck
                for many commercial games. Some code must reside in ROM bank 0. Often the
                amount of code that must reside in ROM bank 0 is larger than a person expects
                until he gets deep into a large project. Commercial GB programmers often
                have a hard time fitting all the code required in ROM bank 0 when using highly
                optimised assembly code so using C provides even more of a
                challenge.<br>
                Assembly code that uses the HALT command can save up to 5% battery power
                compared to a similar program written in GBDK even if the GBDK program uses
                HALT as well. The reason for more power being required is due to the larger
                code generated by GBDK thus causing the CPU to stay awake longer each game
                loop.<br>
                <br>
                C for use in commercial applications is becoming more popular. It often requires
                less of a learning curve for development for those that already know C fairly
                well. With many key subroutines written in assembly language and called from
                C, many of the issues of code size &amp; execution speed start to disappear.
                It's also an excellent means for porting C code from another platform to
                the GB. <br>
                <br>
                To be able to do many special effects you will probably need to learn assembly
                enough to at least code time-critical interrupts &amp; other
                code.<br>

                Flash carts allow you to test your custom GB code on a GB. You can also use
                them to play commercial GB ROMs that you might obtain from the internet but
                this is illegal. Especially if the commercial ROM is still available for
                sale.<br>
                <br>
                Flash carts are more ideal for testing custom code than <a href="#Emulator">gb
                emulators</a> because emulators often allow you to do things that real GB
                hardware does not allow due to hardware limitations.<br>

                There is currently only one place that publically sells flash carts and that
                is Bung Enterprises Limited. Nintendo sells a 32mbit flash cart (one with
                &amp; one without rumble support) but this is only available for sale to
                licensed developers. The Super Smart Card made by China Coach Limited is
                no longer available and the company itself is out of business. The C3 cart
                made by Jeff Frohwein is no longer available.<br>

                ISAS is the official gameboy assembler that Nintendo recommends. ISAS is
                short for <a href="http://www.intsys.co.jp/">Intelligent Systems</a>
                ASsembler.<br>
                <br>
                However, this assembler isn't required for official development. Some official
                developers use RGBDS, TASM, and probably GBDK as well.<br>

                The <a href="http://www.intsys.co.jp/">Intelligent Systems</a> Debugger (US$4000)
                or Emulator (US$3000) are the most common hardware development tools. They
                connect to the SCSI port of an IBM-PC and allow downloading 8mbit files in
                just a few seconds to a GB or GBC. They both support development for projects
                as large as 64mbits. A special cart with a cable connecting the cart to the
                ISAS hardware is used to allow running the downloaded program on a GB. Both
                of these units also allow programming Nintendo flash carts. (These flash
                carts are only available to licensed developers as well.)<br>
                <br>
                Other official developers use a <a href="#Emulator">gb emulator</a> program
                that runs on an IBM-PC to do most testing and occasionally test their programs
                on the real GB hardware by using a <a href="#FlashCart">flash

                These files are raw ROM files. There is no header or trailer information
                in these files. This is the exact data that is contained in cart ROMs. Also,

                carts</a>.<br>
                <br>
                The .GB indicates that the rom contains GB but no GBC code. The .GBC indicates
                that the ROM supports GB &amp; GBC or GBC only.<br>

                An MBC is a Memory Bank Controller. It is required any time time you have
                more than 32k bytes (256kbits) of cart ROM or more than 8k bytes (64kbits)
                of cart RAM because the GB &amp; GBC can only access up to this amount of
                cart ROM &amp; RAM at any one time. <br>
                <br>
                Here are brief descriptions of each MBC. Listed values are the maximum supported
                ROM &amp; RAM. Many/most carts do not use the maximum ROM &amp; RAM that
                the MBC type is capable of supporting. For the complete &amp; most accurate
                differences check <a href="#Docs">here</a>:<br>
                <br>
                MBC1 - 2M bytes ROM/8k bytes RAM -or- 512k bytes ROM/32k bytes RAM<br>
                MBC2 - 256k bytes ROM/512 nybbles RAM (nybble = 4 bits)<br>
                MBC3 - 32M bytes ROM/32k bytes RAM, Real Time Clock support (not available
                in all MBC3 carts)<br>
                MBC5 - 64M bytes ROM/128K bytes RAM (First MBC guaranteed to handle GBC double
                speed mode. Other MBCs handle double speed even though there is no
                guarantee.)<br>
                HuC1 - An MBC similar to MBC1 but with InfraRed (IR) transmit &amp; receive
                capability.<br>
                TAMA5 - This is a special MBC that Bandai put out for for Tamagotchi 3
                (Japanese). This is the only cart capable of making simple sounds while the
                GB itself is turned off.<br>

                This usually requires that you submit samples of your work to Nintendo. Often
                this even means submitting a game that is nearly complete in order that Nintendo
                might better realize your potential for code, graphics, &amp; sound. Without
                them having something to see there is no real incentive for them to seriously
                listen to your objectives. But that's just one opinion....<br>

                <br>
                From a collective feedback from many people it appears that it takes a special
                publisher to publish an original work. Many publishers don't want original
                work but rather would prefer to tell you what to port from an Arcade,N64,PC,PSX,
                or motion picture to GBC.<br>
                One reason might be that few people want to take responsibility if an original
                title does not do well. If a game that is ported to GBC doesn't sell well
                then they can say "That's strange, the version for XYZ sold well so this
                one should have done well in sales." If an original game doesn't sell well
                there is always some guy in the company (if the company is large enough)
                that will say "told you so, I thought it was a dumb idea."<br>
                Another reason might be that no one has heard of original titles and so they
                are less likely to buy it on the shelves. I know there have been cases where
                parents have come up to me in stores and asked me what they should buy for
                their kid even though they don't know me. It seems that very often people
                want to surprise their kids or their relatives kids with a game rather then
                ask them what they want. They often pick any game title they recognize. The
                recognition is often due to the fact that the game is a conversion from another
                game or a movie.<br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, if you have already done some GBC titles then some companies
                are willing to sit down and discuss your original ideas once they have some
                confidence in your proven programming ability, project reliability, and
                demonstrated speed.<br>
                <br>
                If you have never done work for the company you are talking with, your game
                often must be complete (or 99.9% anyway) before they can make any decisions
                on whether to publish it or not. (On incomplete games they have no idea what
                sound or graphics that you might add later that they might find offensive
                or annoying so it's rare to get any decisions until a game is complete or
                until they have experience working with you.)<br>
                <br>
                Don't expect people that don't know you extremely well to hand out email
                addresses or other contact information to companies. No one wants to get
                an email that says, "Why did you refer this guy to me? He has minimal talent
                and he harasses me contantly with ROMs by email!" To get games to the right
                people you generally have to go to large game industry shows and meet as
                many people as you can. You need to take your completed game with you to
                the show. Make appointments with every GBC publisher at the show if possible.
                If the game looks promising and is "flashy" that might get them to look at
                it. If the game is good and has depth then that might even get them to publish
                it.<br>
                <br>
                A game that you have done yourself needs to look atleast as good as the average
                GBC game available. Often it has to look better or do something unique that
                no other game does to keep a publishers attention long enough for them to
                consider publishing it. (Get someone that doesn't know you to judge it to
                get an honest opinion.) Some publishers won't publish it even if it's the
                best game they've seen if it isn't the type of game that they "typically"
                publish. Some companies only publish movie conversions, some only publish
                sports titles, etc...<br>
                <br>
                Here is what Doug Tennapel (creator of Earthworm Jim) had to say in a interview
                on gamasutra.com:<br>
                <blockquote>
                    <i>Have you any advice for developers starting out on their own and looking
                    to land publishing deals ?</i>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    Get a great lawyer, do the best work in the industry and you will get a
                    publishing deal. Most developers don't pay attention to the "best work in
                    the industry" part so I'll repeat it: if you don't do the best work in the
                    industry, nobody will or should take a chance on you.
                </blockquote>

                    <strong>Small Publishers</strong> - Be very careful about sending your game
                    to a small publisher even if they sign an NDA first. There often is a reason
                    they are small. They often are honest and trying to break into the market
                    or they can be corrupt. It doesn't take much for a small company to get your
                    game ROM, have their own hackers modify it slightly, copyright it in their
                    own country, and then sell it to some foreign country for a profit. With
                    you receiving nothing in return except them giving you a notice, "We don't
                    think your game is suitable for publication but please submit any future
                    complete games to us for consideration."<br>
                    <br>
                    Do NOT sent your complete game to a small publisher unless they can give
                    you references to people for which they have published work. If they can't
                    give you references this should set off some major alarms in your head. Either
                    you are their first "experiment" at entering into publishing or they could
                    be corrupt. Keep in mind as well that 9 out of 10 companies fail in their
                    first year of business.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Large Publishers</strong> - The larger a company gets, the more that
                    company can get to a point where the left hand doesn't know what the right
                    hand is doing. (A case in point is that Nintendo of America has made some
                    announcements before about products to be introduced or not introduced and
                    Nintendo of Japan [the main location] soon after made a decision that basically
                    reversed the announcement made by NOA.)<br>
                    <br>
                    In other words, you can't just expect to send your brand new, state-of-the-art,
                    best-graphics-in-the-world GBC game to anyone in the company and expect them
                    to forward it to the actual decision makers. Many people in large companies
                    could care less about what you have done. Many would not know what to do
                    with a ROM even if you sent it to them. Often, your email goes directly to
                    the trash if it is sent to the wrong person. Meeting people at game industry
                    shows is probably the best method for meeting the right people. <br>
                    <br>
                    Keep in mind as well that fast decisions or any decisions at all are often
                    harder to get from large publishers. Their main way of doing things is to
                    let their market research department decide what to publish
                    next.<br>

                You need a Doctor GB Card (flash cart) 4Mbit, 16Mbit, or 64Mbit, GB XChanger
                (required to program the flash cart), a parallel cable, and an adapter or
                batteries to power the GB Xchanger.<br>
                <br>
                Make sure when you order you get the newer version flash carts as these require
                much less battery power. (Expect about 1-2 hours battery life with older
                flash carts, ~10 hours with newer flash carts.)<br>
                <br>
                If you order direct from Bung then get their male-to-male DB25 parallel cable.
                Some of their distributors don't carry this cable but it is required in order
                to program a cart. You can order this cable elsewhere as long as it is a
                "straight-through" cable not longer than 6 foot. Not all male-to-male DB25
                cables are "straight-through" so make sure you know what you are getting.
                (A lap-link cable will not work.) If it is longer than 6 foot you may encounter
                some reliability problems.<br>
                <br>
                You can use 6 AAA batteries or any 8-12 volt DC negative-center adapter for

                On power up, cart RAM access is disabled. If you are using GBDK, however,
                cart RAM may be enabled as part of the power up sequence but don't assume
                this to always be true in every version of GBDK.<br>
                <br>
                Cart RAM should only be enabled when you are actively reading from or writing
                to it if you wish to preserve data during power off. Cart RAM contents can
                possibly be partially or totally lost if a power off occurs while cart RAM

                <br>
                The GB Pocket &amp; GB Classic at power up would display the graphic logo
                in the ROM and then test to make sure that the logo was accurate. For these
                units you could do some ROM hardware tricks that would swap the graphic logo
                ROM contents after the logo was displayed and then the game would boot
                properly.<br>
                <br>
                The GBC has more sophisticated testing so it may or may not be possible.
                On power up, the GBC tests the logo area by reading each ROM location of
                the logo once. If any byte is incorrect the GBC just lockups up. Then, it
                starts from the beginning of the logo and reads each ROM location of the
                logo twice before going to the next byte of the logo. During these reads
                it puts the graphics data to the screen and tests the graphic logo again.
                If it fails this second test the GBC just lockups up.<br>
                <br>
                The testing that all GBs use to check the accuracy of the graphic logos appears
                to be a byte-for-byte compare rather than checksum method of
                testing.<br>

                Emulator can be a confusing word because it have several meanings depending
                on where it is used:<br>
                <br>
                A GB emulator is a piece of software that runs on a computer and emulates
                a GB and/or GBC. The reality is that none of the GB emulators available perfectly
                emulate the real hardware but some come close. Many think that NO$GMB has
                the current best GB/GBC/SGB emulation &amp; it also has a powerful debugger
                for helping developers with coding. SMYGB for Win95 currently is thought
                by many to have the best sound emulation but it can't play channel 3 sound
                samples very well.<br>
                <br>
                An EPROM emulator is a piece of hardware that perfectly emulates a ROM or
                EPROM chip. They often connect to the parallel port of a PC and connect to
                a ROM socket. Software code changes can often be downloaded in seconds to
                the ROM socket. EPROM emulators are not very practical for most as they tend
                to be very expensive &amp; require that you physically solder a socket onto
                a GB cart to allow connecting an EPROM emulator to the cart.<br>
                <br>
                The emulator that <a href="#ProHardware">Intelligent Systems</a> sells is
                basically an expensive EPROM emulator. The debugger they sell is the same
                thing along with hardware break points, trace history buffer, and other debug
                features. They both program Nintendo flash carts as well.<br>

                * Emulators tend to set all of RAM to $00 on power up. Real GBs do NOT initialize
                RAM on power up. RAM is filled with random values on power up. You must clear
                it yourself if you wish it to be set to some known value.<br>
                <br>
                * The real hardware could care less about the ROM checksum ($14e,$14f) but
                the complement check ($14d) MUST be correct or programs will "lock up" after
                scrolling the Nintendo logo. (Use RGBFIX -V if you are coding in
                assembly.)<br>
                <br>
                * The Nintendo scrolling graphic from $104 - $133 must be accurate. If one
                byte of it is changed then your programs will "lock up" after scrolling this
                graphic logo.<br>
                <br>
                * When the LCD display is off (bit 7 of $ff40 set to 0) you can write to
                video memory at any time with out restrictions. While it is on you can only
                write to video memory during H-Blank and V-Blank. Emulators tend to allow
                you to write to video memory at any time.<br>
                <br>
                * The LCD display is on at reset (bit 7 of $ff40 set to 1). Before the LCD
                display can be turned off you must wait for V-Blank. If you don't wait for
                V-Blank, once in a while SGB code will just lock up and possibly some GBC
                will not operate correctly.<br>
                <br>
                * Normally you should only make changes to Sprite RAM during V-Blank unless
                you know exactly what you are doing. The common way to do this is to use
                the Sprite DMA register ($ff46) to do a fast copy from your sprite table
                to sprite RAM at $fe00-$fe9f.<br>

            <dd>
                <br>
                This is because code has been added to in order to do "colo(u)r correction"
                . This "correction" code creates washed out colo(u)rs to better simulate
                how the game appears (or would appear) on the real GBC
                hardware.<br>
                <br>
                Often, GB emulators (such as no$gmb) have a configuration option to enable
                or disable this "auto correction" feature.<br>
                <br>
                The consensus seems to be that greens and blues reproduce well on the GBC

                None of this is true except possibly the first one. You might can do more
                than 4 colo(u)rs but only through creative palette manipulation during H-Blank.
                This is not practical for many things and is only achievable if you know

                The ability to turn individual pixels on &amp; off on the screen is often
                called APA (or All Points Addressable) graphics.<br>
                <br>
                On the GBC you can do this by putting a unique tile at each screen map location.
                Since the GBC can have 512 unique tiles, 360 of these are enough to cover
                the entire screen (20x18 tiles.) Then you can set individual screen pixels
                to any colo(u)r by writing to tile memory.<br>
                <br>
                On the other GBs (pocket, classic, super) you only have access to 256 tiles
                at one time which is less than the 360 unique tiles required to fill the
                screen. But, by using a LYC interrupt you can switch from tile set #1 to
                tile set #2 midscreen. This effectively allows you access to up to 384 unique
                tiles (since tile set #1 &amp; #2 half overlap each other) which is enough
                to fill the screen to allow APA graphics.<br>

                <br>
                The SGB is able to colo(u)rize GB games using primitive techniques that involve
                sending information to the SNES/Super Famicon. As such, if you attempt to
                scroll the screen it is sometimes a slow process to send new information
                to the SNES so colo(u)rized, scrolling screens are difficult to
                implement.<br>
                <br>
                The GBC, on the other hand, does all colo(u)rizing itself using totally different
                methods. As a result, colo(u)rized games written for the GBC will not work
                on the SGB &amp; vice versa.<br>

                <br>
                The GB window map appears on top of the background and can only be scrolled
                to the right and down from the upper left screen coordinate. You can scroll
                it up as long as the Y coordinate is &gt;=0. You can scroll it left as long
                as X coordinate is &gt;=-7. The window is often used as a status bar on the
                right or bottom of the screen. No part of the window can ever be made transparent
                to the background under it.<br>

                <br>
                The reason you often will get graphic trash is because the LYC interrupt,
                itself, is getting delayed from occurring perfectly on time due to some other
                interrupt (usually due to a timer, serial, or hi/lo interrupt.)<br>
                <br>
                One way to fix this is to make sure that the screen line that this occurs
                on is always one solid colo(u)r. In this way, the problem still occurs but
                isn't visibly noticeable so for all practical purposes the problem is
                "fixed".<br>
                <br>
                Another way to fix this problem is to have the LYC interrupt occur one line
                before you actually need it. Then, use a tight loop waiting for the LY register
                to equal the next line. If the other interrupt code (that is causing this
                problem) is extremely long then you may need to set the LYC interrupt to
                occur several lines or more before it is actually needed. Mortal Kombat 3
                &amp; 4 for GB use this technique to prevent graphic trash.<br>

                This is because all versions of GB (i.e. GB,GBC,GBP,SGB,...) have interlaced
                screens and are redrawn 30 times a second. (i.e. All odd lines are drawn
                in one screen refresh, all even lines are drawn in the next screen refresh.)
                As a result, if you scroll a picture up or down 1 pixel each V-Blank you
                are seeing every other line twice during scrolling. (Info of GBC interlace
                from Pan of Anthrox.)<br>
                <br>
                The GB screen isn't a true interlaced screen. It appears that every line
                is redrawn with every screen redraw but every other line is just much
                dimmer.<br>

                It's not a good idea to turn off the screen unless you are in V-blank for
                the following reasons:<br>
                <br>
                - Code written for the Super GameBoy will not always work if you don't wait
                until V-blank to switch off the screen. The screen "glitch" caused by turning
                the screen off during redraw can sometimes cause the Super GameBoy screen
                to "lockup" until reset is pressed.<br>
                <br>
                - It has been reported that Nintendo rejects game titles during the acceptance
                phase if they don't wait until V-blank to turn off the screen. It has also
                been reported by Nintendo Acceptance that some code can physically damage
                the GBC screen circuitry over time. It is believed (but not verified) that
                this damage occurs due to not waiting until V-blank to turn off the
                screen.<br>
                <br>
                Here is assembly code that is similar to what Nintendo suggests:<br>

                in the video timing ?</a></strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <br>
                The terms H-blank &amp; V-blank are a part of Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) based
                video games and as a result they have carried over to some LCD-based games.
                The H-blank period is the amount of time it takes the scanning electron beam
                to return to the left part of the screen and the V-blank period is the amount
                of time it takes the scanning electron beam to return to the top of the screen
                for CRT displays.<br>
                <br>
                Since the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) of the GB doesn't have an electron
                beam there are no lag times that require an H-blank or a V-blank period.
                Since the GB doesn't have dual-port video RAM, allocating these times anyway
                provides a convenient time for writes to video RAM since the video circuits
                aren't updating the screen during these periods (and as such aren't preventing
                access to video RAM during these periods.)<br>

                An interrupt is a piece of code that starts executing automatically when
                an event occurs. To do this it has to interrupt whatever code was running
                before the event occurred. As part of this, the Program Counter (PC) is saved
                on the GB stack and interrupts are turned off as soon as the interrupt code
                starts executing. At the end of the interrupt, a RETI assembly instruction
                is usually executed which returns to executing code that was running before
                the interrupt occurred and enables interrupts again.<br>

                You should often try to keep your interrupt code as short &amp; fast as possible.
                In many cases, no other interrupt can take place while you are servicing
                an interrupt so shorter interrupt code can be helpful.<br>

            <dd>
                <br>
                Normally, no. When an interrupt occurs it automatically executes a Disable
                Interrupts (DI) command. As a result, no other interrupt can be serviced
                until servicing of that interrupt is complete and the assembly instruction
                RETI is executed.<br>
                <br>
                To allow an interrupt to interrupt an interrupt you need to put an Enable
                Interrupt (EI) instruction at the beginning of each interrupt routine where
                interrupting will be allowed.<br>

                <br>
                RET is just a return from subroutine. RETI is two commands in one. RETI is
                EI / RET in that order. The command EI doesn't take effect immediately but
                DI does. EI takes effect following the instruction that follows
                it.<br>

                <br>
                The HI/LO interrupt occurs (if enabled) when a button on the GB is pressed.
                The reality is that this interrupt can occur several times during the process
                of pressing a button and several times while releasing a button due to button
                "bounce" that often occurs but few realize it.<br>

                <br>
                No. Specifically, when working in assembly you need a small delay between
                EI &amp; DI. If you insert a NOP command between EI &amp; DI then this allows
                the interrupt enable command to complete before DI takes effect. Thus allowing
                all pending interrupts to be serviced before interrupts are disabled. Any
                pending interrupts will be serviced in the order of their priority and they
                all will be serviced at once before control is returned to non-interrupt
                code.<br>
                <br>
                The reason this delay is needed is because the assembly command EI doesn't
                take effect immediately but DI does. EI takes effect following the instruction
                that follows it.<br>

                There is one Int $48 signal. When this signal goes from "off" to "on" the
                LCDC flag in the register IF ($ff0f) gets set, and ONLY on off-to-on transitions.
                <br>
                <br>
                If the signal is already "on", say by a true (and enabled) LYC=LY condition,
                then a further interrupt in the same line (say HBLANK int is enabled as well)
                would set the int48 signal as well, but it's already set so no off-to-on
                transition, no further interrupt generated.<br>
                <br>
                But the HBLANK interrupt could occur if LYC=LY would get disabled or false
                (lyc changed) within the line, ie. if int48 signal gets off for a short moment.

                You possibly could use pin 4 of the link port on the GBC as a serial input.
                You would need to write a software UART to handle the input data. Since there
                would be no interrupt involved in monitoring this input pin you would need
                to devote a good bit of CPU time to monitoring this pin &amp; probably no
                interrupts would be feasible while looking for serial data.<br>
                <br>
                As far as the GB Pocket or GB Classic goes, the standard serial in &amp;

                This might possibly be the single most difficult thing on the GB to program:
                GB-to-GB link code. First, get chapters 4 &amp; 5 of the official GB development
                manual. You might even can locate these somewhere on the internet. You have
                2 different options. The chapter 4 (simple code) or chapter 5 (complicated
                code). If you wish to transfer more than 1 byte per vblank then you MUST
                use chapter 5 code for reliability<br>
                <br>
                Chapter 4 has two different modes. The first mode is synchronization (before
                the game starts) and this flowchart is shown on the first page. The second
                mode is "after the game starts" flowchart which is shown on page 2.

                When a DMG (GB Pocket or Classic) and CGB are linked together, and an AC
                Adaptor is used, line noise may occur. This noise can cause communication
                problems with the SCK (link clock), which could bit-shift received data.
                This seems to occur mainly when the DMG is the Master mode (using its internal
                clock.) This problem doesn't seem to occur when the GBC is the
                master.<br>
                <br>
                There are two ways to solve this. You can forcibly make the GBC the master,
                or you can create better error checking routines to correct this problem.
                Nintendo recommends using the latter option.<br>

                This depends on whether you are talking about clock cycles or machine cycles.
                Nintendo specifications list machine cycles. Many internet document
                specifications list clock cycles.<br>
                <br>
                The GB &amp; GBC can operate at ~1 million machine cycles/sec or ~4 million
                clock cycles/sec. The GBC in double-speed mode can operate at ~2 million
                machine cycles/sec or ~8 million clock cycles/sec.<br>
                <br>
                The simplest assembly instruction in the GB &amp; GBC is a NOP. It takes
                1 machine cycle or 4 clock cycles for this instruction to
                execute.<br>

                <strong> Sprite DMA</strong> -<br>
                This is the original DMA that is available on all models of GB. It is used
                to do a fast copy of sprite attribute data to Object (sprite) Attribute Memory
                (OAM) located at $fe00-$fe9f. Sprite attribute data includes sprite X &amp;
                Y coordinates, tile number, palette number, horizontal flip, vertical flip,
                and sprite priority. No tile graphics are transferred using this method of
                DMA.<br>
                This method of DMA usually is only performed in high RAM ($ff80-$fffe) due
                to its

                <strong>HDMA</strong> -<br>
                Otherwise known as Horizontal Blank DMA. It is only available on the GBC.
                Similar to GDMA, this method of DMA is useful for copying tile graphics or
                tile maps to video RAM. There are many restrictions to using HDMA listed
                <a href="#GBCHDMA">here</a> but it can be powerful if used carefully. Unlike
                the other two methods of DMA, this one is most practical for allowing other
                processing to take place while HDMA is occurring. More specifically, the
                CPU is used completely during H-blank to process HDMA but at all other times
                user code may be doing other things.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>GDMA</strong> -<br>
                Otherwise known as General Purpose DMA. It is only available on the GBC.
                Similar to HDMA, this method of DMA is useful for copying tile graphics or
                tile maps to video RAM. There are some restrictions listed
                <a href="#GBCGDMA">here</a> for using GDMA but far less than for HDMA. While
                GDMA is active, the CPU is completely devoted to DMA and no other processing
                takes place until GDMA is done.<br>

                Yes. Rom location $143 was turned into a flag that indicated a GBC game so

                This stops the CPU until an interrupt occurs. Nintendo recommends using this
                command in your main game loop in order to save battery power while the CPU
                has nothing else to do.<br>
                <br>
                When an interrupt occurs while in HALT, the CPU starts back up and pushes
                the Program Counter onto the stack before servicing the interrupt(s). Except
                it doesn't push the address after HALT as one might expect but rather the
                address of HALT itself.<br>
                <br>
                HALT operates differently depending on whether the Interrupt Master Enable
                (IME) is set or reset. Assembly command EI sets IME to 1. Assembly command
                DI resets IME to 0.<br>
                <br>
                <pre><strong>IME = 1 -</strong>

     HALT stops the CPU until the register IF ($ff0f) &amp;
    register IE ($ffff) when logically ANDed together
    have a non-zero result.

     HALT will only start the CPU upon a 0 to 1 transition
    of one of the bits of the non-zero result. (i.e. Pending
    interrupts that occurred before HALT was executed will
    not terminate HALT.)


<strong>IME = 0 -</strong>

    <strong>[$ff0f].AND.[$ffff] = 0 :</strong>

        HALT is aborted. Next instruction is executed normally.

         If IME is set to 1 at a later time then a halt condition
        will occur one instruction after IME is set to 1 to complete
        the halt that was not allowed to finish earlier.

    <strong>[$ff0f].AND.[$ffff] &gt; 0 :</strong>

         HALT is aborted. The first byte of the next instruction
        after HALT is read. The Program Counter (PC) fails to
        increment to the next memory location. As a results, the
        first byte after HALT is read again. From this point on
        the Program Counter once again operates normally.

         If IME is set to 1 at a later time then a halt condition
        will occur one instruction after IME is set to 1 to complete
        the halt that was not allowed to finish earlier.

                    <br>
                    Nintendo also recommends that you put a NOP after HALT commands. The reason
                    for this is that the Program Counter will not increment properly (CPU bug)
                    if you try to do a HALT while IME = 0 and an interrupt is pending. A single-byte
                    instruction immediately following HALT will get executed twice if IME = 0
                    and an interrupt is pending. If the instruction following HALT is a multi-byte
                    instruction then the game could hang or registers could get
                    scrambled.<br>
                    <br>
                    IME is set to 1 even if the assembly instruction EI is executed immediately
                    before the HALT instruction.<br>
                    <br>
                    Later versions of the RGBASM compiler automatically add a NOP after
                    HALT.<br>

                This stops the CPU &amp; turns off the display until a button is
                pressed.<br>
                <br>
                In addition, STOP can be used to <a href="#AsmToggle">toggle CPU speed</a>
                on the GBC.<br>
                <br>
                If a game is idle for 5 minutes or longer you should possibly consider using
                STOP to stop the CPU &amp; turn off the display to conserve power. Everything
                is restored after a STOP just by pressing a button. If you use STOP for
                conversing power you should also consider disabling sound (reset bit 7 of
                NR52) as the sound circuits seem to draw the most amount of power.<br>

                The value in register P1 ($ff00) determines which buttons will terminate

                <br>
                Yes. There is the <a href="#SpriteBug">sprites bug</a> that was fixed in
                the GBC and also the following that doesn't apply to the GBC.<br>
                <br>
                In certain situations, writing to the STAT register ($ff41) seems to cause
                bit 1 of the IF register ($ff0f) to be set (and thus cause interrupt $48
                to occur, if it is enabled). Due to programming bugs, at least two games
                (Roadrash, Legend of Zerd) insist on this quirk, and are incompatible with
                the GBC. <br>
                <br>
                As far as has been figured out, the bug happens everytime ANYTHING (including
                00) is written to the STAT register ($ff41) while the gameboy is either in
                HBLANK or VBLANK mode. It doesn't seem to happen when the gameboy is in OAM
                or VRAM mode, or when the display is disabled. (Info from Martin
                Korth.)<br>

                Yes. The byte at location $143 in a ROM determines whether the GBC operates
                in GBC mode ($80 or $c0) or 4-color GB mode (any other value.) That is the
                official info anyway. Martin Korth has found that any of the following binary
                values at $143 cause strange sprite colors &amp; white-only background colors
                always (X = don't care):<br>
                <br>
                1XXX01XX<br>
                1XXX10XX<br>
                1XXX11XX<br>
                <br>
                It is as if bits 2 and/or 3 being set cause the colo(u)r palette registers
                to be write-protected. On power up, the sprite palettes tend to be random
                pastel colo(u)rs &amp; the background palettes are white.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                If you read HDMA5 ($ff55) after starting an HDMA you will read back the tile
                count you wrote except the high bit will be 0. Every H-blank this count will
                decrement. After reaching $00 it will change to $ff indicating that HDMA
                has completed. (i.e. If bit 7 is 0 HDMA is busy, otherwise HDMA is
                done.)<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                There are also several undocumented registers (info from Dark
                Fader):<br>
                <br>
                $FF6C - bit 0 can be read/written<br>
                $FF72-$FF74 - whole byte can be read/written<br>
                $FF75 - bit 4-6 can be read/written<br>
                $FF76-$FF77 - Read only &amp; set to $00<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                For the record, Nintendo recommends against using undocumented registers
                in order that your code will work properly with future releases of hardware.
                It is not clear whether the bit that tells you that HDMA is done was accidentally
                undocumented or undocumented on purpose.<br>

                Use the following code. You must set register P1 ($ff00) to $30 or else a
                button held down can cause STOP to not complete the process of changing speeds.
                Register KEY1 ($ff4d) bit 0 is used as a flag to determine if STOP should
                turn off the display &amp; wait for a button or toggle the CPU speed:<br>

            <dd>
                <br>
                No better performance can be obtained by using high RAM for the GB stack.
                But, if you are coding in assembly language, some opcodes are optimized (and
                hence operate faster) when using high RAM for data storage. For high performance
                code it is actually better to put the GB stack in lower RAM and use high
                RAM for data storage instead.<br>
                <br>
                Sprite DMA code must be performed in high RAM because all other memory is
                disabled during Sprite DMA.<br>

                <br>
                In the world of GB, Metatiles are virtual tiles that are larger than 8x8
                pixels. In many/most cases, metatiles are 16x16 pixel virtual tiles. In some
                cases they are 8x16, 16x8, 32x32, or even larger. Metatiles are most often
                used anywhere that you have large scrolling maps.<br>
                <br>
                Games such as Donkey Kong Land 3, Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat 4, and Tarzan
                all use 16x16 metatiles. These games use a metatile map as well. Each position
                of this map usually contains 1 or 2 bytes. If each position has one byte
                then up to 256 unique metatiles can be used by the map. These metatile maps
                can be nearly 4 (or 8 for the GBC) times smaller (ROM space wise) than a
                similar tile map that doesn't use metatiles. If each position of the map
                uses 2 bytes then the map can support many unique metatiles. These metatile
                maps can be 2 (or 4 for the GBC) times smaller (ROM space wise) than a similar
                tile map that doesn't use metatiles.<br>
                <br>
                Each position of a metatile map has an index into a metatile lookup table.
                Each position in the metatile lookup table often has 4 bytes (assuming 16x16
                metatiles) that index 4 different 8x8 tiles in the tile table and there are
                often 4 more bytes (assuming 16x16 metatiles) that hold the tile attributes
                for these tiles for GBC support.<br>
                <br>
                When using metatiles, you lose some ROM space due to the addition of a metatile
                table but you often gain much more ROM space than you lose due to the much
                smaller map(s). The space savings often means that you can put a much larger
                map (pixel-wise) into a single ROM bank which can make things easier programming
                wise.<br>
                <br>
                The concept of metatiles often assumes as well that 8x8 tiles will be used
                in multiple metatiles. This is often a very good assumption because the GB
                &amp; GBC just don't have enough 8x8 tiles available to provide unique tiles
                at every screen location in large, scrolling maps. It is possible to dynamically
                load unique tiles at the edges of a scrolling screen (in order to have all
                unique tiles) but the ROM space required for all of these unique tiles can
                often be prohibitive.<br>

                Yes. The following table illustrates power usage by the GBC. Sound is enabled
                by setting bit 7 of register NR52 ($ff26). Using assembly language command
                HALT in your main game loop saves power. 2X Spd is double speed mode. Infrared
                Receive is enabled by setting bits 6 &amp; 7 of register RP ($ff56). Infrared
                Transmit is turned on by setting bit 0 of register RP ($$ff56).<br>
                <br>
                These measurements are for total current (cart &amp; GBC) drawn from the
                batteries. The cart used for testing was an original MBC5 cart with the ROM
                replaced with a low-power flash chip. As a result, these measurements should
                compare to a Nintendo published ROM cart within 1-2 milliamps. The code in
                this example used about 85% of the clock cycles available each game loop.
                (With low power consumption for 15% of each game loop when HALT was used.)
                This probably closely resembles many games.<br>
                <br>
                As can be seen by the results, the best results are obtained by using none
                of the special features available, sound disabled, and using HALT in the
                main game loop. Ideally, your game should use as little battery power as
                is necessary. In other words, do NOT use features that require more battery
                power unless you can not accomplish what you are trying to do without using
                them.<br>
                <br>
                For those that are confused by the values below, consider that a game that
                uses 55 milliamps will run on batteries for twice as many hours as a game
                that uses 110 milliamps. Actually, it will run for a little over twice as
                long but this gets into battery physics that are beyond the scope of these
                FAQs.<br>

            <dd>
                <br>
                Yes, for three reasons:<br>
                <br>
                - Some flash carts program much more quickly when unused spaces in the ROM
                are padded with $ff.<br>
                <br>
                - ROMs that have unused areas padded with a known value (rather than random
                data) compress much better. This is good when you need to send a ROM by email
                or for smaller, compressed, backup archives.<br>
                <br>
                - Padding makes sure that unused sections of the ROM are filled with a known
                value rather than random data in your PC RAM. If you don't use padding sometimes
                source code or other information that you would rather not make public can
                be included in your ROM without your even knowing about it. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                To test code on a GB you often have to pad your ROM size to a multiple of
                2 in order for most flash programming tools to use the file. Padding is just
                unused bytes that are added to fill empty spaces in a ROM or at the end of
                a ROM. The type of padding you choose can greatly vary the amount of time
                it takes to program a Bung (and probably other) flash cart. With padding
                values of $00 being the worst and $ff being the best. Sometimes it can take
                up to 50% longer (maybe even longer) to flash a cart with pad values of $00.
                Here are command line switches for properly padding assembly
                files:<br>
                <br>
                For RGBASM: <strong>-zff</strong><br>
                <br>
                For XLINK (RGBASM linker): <strong>-zff</strong><br>
                <br>
                For RGBFIX (Version by Otaku): <strong>-pff</strong><br>
                <br>
                For TASM: <strong>-fff</strong><br>
                <br>

                can have better sound, as a result, than average GB games.<br>

                Yes. Sound must be turned on before you can set any other sound registers.

                Four bit wave playback - Sound channel 3 has a 4-bit 32 sample long wave
                RAM that you can set for playing a 32 sample waveform repeatedly. It wasn't
                specifically designed to handle continuously new samples but you can refill
                the wave RAM each time 32 samples have been sent to the speaker. This reload
                of RAM process causes the first sample to always be 0 which shows up in sample
                playback as a low frequency buzz sound. Depending on what sounds you are
                playing back this buzz is more or less noticeable.<br>
                <br>
                Your samples will sound a lot clearer (and even louder, apparently) if you
                heavily optimize your sample playback routine. (Info from Jeremy
                Evers.)<br>
                <br>
                One bit wave playback - Some games use volume modulation of register NR51
                ($ff25) to do one bit wave playback. This involves setting, say for instance,
                sound channel 3 wave RAM to all $FF's and then just modulating bits 2 &amp;
                6 of NR51 to do the sound playback.<br>

                <br>
                This is a major problem and as a result it requires careful
                consideration.<br>
                <br>
                For one, use compression (audio, not data) to make the sample
                "stronger".<br>
                <br>
                Also, make sure that the original sound sample files are recorded very strongly.
                If you have to, use a sound editor program to increase the volume of each
                sample. Keep doing this even if the signal starts to clip if you want to
                get more volume.<br>
                <br>
                It is a matter of personal preference as to how much clipping you wish to
                do to the sample. The more clipping you do the louder the sample will be
                with the trade off of adding more distortion. Some samples will be more tolerant
                of distortion than others so keep this in mind.<br>

                Yes. The sound circuits cause your game to use 10-15% more battery power
                even if you aren't actively playing a sound. Write $00 to NR52 ($ff26) to
                disable sound.<br>

                <br>
                If you alter the envelope, the envelope may restart (or at least jump), and
                there are some things you need to take into account. However, if you force
                the envelope to be off (direction up, speed 0), you can easily make software
                envelopes by modulating the high nybble. Sometimes there is some small noise
                associated with this technique, however... (Info from Jeremy

                No. Sound channel 3 must be disabled before you can write data to Wave Pattern

                Yes. A problem with sound being cut off prematurely can occur when several
                conditions are met. The conditions are the following:<br>
                <br>
                - the sound length registers, NR11, NR21 or NR31 - bits 0~6 are non-zero<br>
                - the continuous bit of sound registers NR14, NR24 or NR34 is set to 0
                (continuous)<br>
                - and the initial bit of sound registers NR14, NR24 or NR34 is changed from
                1 to 0 while the upper frequency is incremented or decremented.<br>
                <br>
                This problem seems to be dependent on the value in the sound length registers,
                NR11, NR21 or NR31 - bits 0~6. The larger the value, the sooner it
                stops.<br>
                <br>
                To get around this sound bug, set the duration again after the frequency
                high byte. <br>

                8 x 8 or 8 x 16 pixels. If you use 8 x 16 size sprites then you can only

                number = 2, third sprite number = 4, ...) The lowest bit of the sprite number
                in 8 x 16 sprite mode is always 0 no matter what. (i.e. Selecting sprite
                number 3 gives you sprite number 2 instead.) <br>
                <br>

                When you exceed 10 sprites per horizontal pixel line, only the sprites with
                the highest priorities will completely appear in that pixel line. (Sprite
                #0 has highest priority, sprite #1 next highest, etc.) The other sprites
                will partially or totally disappear (depending on how many of lines of each

                <br>
                If you plan to have more than 10 sprites that at some time will share the

                each vblank. This will cause them to blink annoyingly (but only when the

                Sprite RAM is located from $fe00-$febf. You can write directly to sprite
                RAM to modify the sprite attribute table but you should only do this during
                V-blank for reliability.<br>
                <br>
                Most commercial games don't write directly to sprite RAM. Instead, they use
                sprite DMA ($ff46). You can just setup a sprite attribute table that is 256
                byte aligned ($xx00), in RAM for instance, and then use sprite DMA to transfer
                this table to sprite RAM. Often, sprite DMA is put at the start of a V-blank
                interrupt. As a result, your sprite attribute table is copied to sprite RAM
                automatically each V-blank.<br>

                <br>
                In order to do a sprite DMA you have to have a sprite table with address
                $xx00. (x = don't care) Depending on the address of this sprite table you
                have several options:<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Sprite table not in video RAM ($8000-$9fff)</strong> - Most games
                do not put their sprite table in video RAM but rather usually use low RAM
                ($c000-$dfff). The reason for this is because you can write to low RAM at
                any time but video RAM is picky about writes when the screen is
                on.<br>
                <br>
                When using sprite DMA ($ff46) with a sprite table that is not in video RAM,
                the code which performs this DMA function must be located in high RAM
                ($ff80-$fffe) because, except for video RAM, all other memory areas are disabled.
                The duration of sprite DMA is ~160 (80 in double speed)
                microseconds.<br>
                <br>
                In order to do this you have to copy a small routine to high RAM containing
                the DMA command, a small delay loop, and a RET instruction to return to the
                main routine that called it. Interrupts MUST be disabled during non-video
                RAM sprite table DMAs. Example assembly code (rDMA=$ff46):<br>
                <br>
                <pre><strong>; $c000 ~ c09f --&gt; OAM</strong>

                    <strong>Sprite table in video RAM ($8000-$9fff)</strong> - If you choose
                    to put your sprite table in video RAM then you can perform sprite DMA using
                    code in ROM (no need to call high RAM) and you don't have to wait for DMA
                    completion. Also, interrupts don't have to be disabled to use sprite DMA
                    in this case. Example assembly code (rDMA=$ff46):<br>

                The terminology "background" sprite is in reference to a virtual sprite,
                not a physical sprite. It is a software technique that is used that makes
                it appear that you are using sprite hardware but in reality you are
                not.<br>
                <br>
                This was a popular technique that was used in such games as Mortal Kombat
                2 in order to draw the actors. It involves writing directly into the background
                map. You can even do smooth, single pixel scrolls of "background" sprites
                that contain transparent pixels if your code is advanced enough to handle
                that.<br>
                <br>
                Since the release of the GBC, this technique is not as feasible to implement
                due to limitations of the GBC background colo(u)r palettes.<br>

                Yes, but it is tricky. Ferrari for GB does this. You have to use an LYC interrupt

                Among sprites themselves, sprite #0 has highest priority, sprite #1 has next
                highest priority, etc.(i.e. Sprite #0 will always appear over sprite
                #1.)<br>
                <br>
                Bit 7 of the sprite attribute flags determines that a sprite will appear
                above the background &amp; window if it is 0 and below them both (visible
                only through colo(u)r 0 of background &amp; window) if it is 1.<br>
                <br>
                When bit 7 of bank 1 of tile attribute memory ($9800-$9fff) is set to 1 it
                will force the background and/or window to have priority over the sprite
                attribute flags and to appear over sprites no matter what the setting of
                the sprite attribute flags.<br>
                <br>
                If bit 0 of register LCDC ($ff40) is 0 then sprites will always appear above

                Here are the main differences between the two most popular &amp; easily available
                assemblers:<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>TASM Advantages:</strong> <br>
                <br>
                * Allows quick development for short programs because it's a "simple" compiler
                with linker built in.<br>
                <br>
                * Supports 0xh (hex) &amp; 0xb (binary) formats preferred by some that don't
                like using $x for hex &amp; %x for binary numbers.<br>
                <br>
                * Has a nice listing output for the compiler results.<br>
                <br>
                * Allows using '[]' or '()' to reference memory. (If you are using the latest
                TASM table...)<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>RGBASM Advantages:</strong><br>
                <br>
                * Allows development of GameBoy programs up to 4Mbytes in size. To develop
                a ROM larger than 32kbytes in size using TASM you have to paste files together
                using DOS "copy /b f1+f2 f3" or something similar. If you plan on calling
                code in 2 or more different ROM banks you have to assemble these files separately
                and manually make sure that CALLs or JPs to these banks are valid as the
                assembler is incapable of catching errors in this case.<br>
                <br>
                * Allows including all or part of a raw binary data file into your program.
                Often this means data such as a tileset, tile map, etc. To do this with TASM
                you have to convert the binary data to the format .byte $xx,$xx,$xx,$xx,....
                using a program such as 'dump' by Jens Ch. Restemeier.<br>
                <br>
                * Has a macro language which blows tasm away. Period.<br>
                <br>
                * Automatically optimizes 'LD' instructions. A 'LD' from $ff00-$ffff takes
                two bytes. A 'LD' from the rest of memory takes three bytes. TASM isn't capable
                enough to auto-optimize.<br>
                <br>
                * Allows local labels between standard labels:<br>
                <br>
                <pre><strong>Test1:</strong>
<strong>        ld      a,[x]</strong>
<strong>.loop:</strong>
<strong>        dec     a</strong>
<strong>        jr      nz,.loop</strong>
<strong></strong>
<strong>Test2:</strong>
<strong>        ld      a,[x]</strong>
<strong>.loop:</strong>
<strong>        dec     a</strong>
<strong>        jr      nz,.loop</strong>
</pre>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    (Local labels start with .) You can not do this with TASM. Local labels are
                    very helpful in large code projects.<br>
                    <br>
                    * Has a compiler directive BANK(x) that returns the bank number in which
                    label 'x' resides. As a result, it is easy to build a macro such as 'lcall
                    x' that does a call from bank-to-bank and you don't have to specifically
                    state which bank you wish to call. (The macro will figure this out for you
                    by using BANK(x).) With TASM you'd have to do something like 'lcall 5,x'
                    in which you specify the bank and the address in the bank you wish to
                    CALL.<br>
                    <br>
                    * Uses an Assembler / Linker setup so you can use Borland or GNU MAKE. Therefore
                    don't have to recompile your whole project when making a minor
                    change.<br>

                The basic building blocks of the GB display are tiles. As such, it is handy
                to have a tile editor to allow you to design tiles that are to be displayed

                A map editor allows you to take tiles that you have designed and arrange
                these into a 2 dimensional map of arbitrary X and Y size. The GB has a built-in
                hardware tile map that is composed of 8x8 pixel tiles and the map itself
                is 32x32 tiles wide/high. As such, tile maps of 32x32 tiles are

                Even though the tile map in the GB is limited to 32x32 tiles, you can display
                maps larger than this by dynamically updating the hardware tile map during
                screen scrolling.<br>
