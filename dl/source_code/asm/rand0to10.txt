You can get some random number generater code from
http://www.devrs.com/gb/files/random.txt, courtisy of Jeff Frohwein.  The
code will give you a value in register A, $00 through $FF.  To get ten, just
use this code:



    and    $0F    ;get right half, 0-15 (this instruction may not be needed)
    cp    10        ; check if over 10
    jr    c,    3       ;is it?
    jp    nz,    tena ;yep
done:
(whatever goes here, ret, jp, whatever you need)


tena:                ;yep,  change back to ten
    ld    a,    10
    ret


this is just some code i wrote quick, you probably want to test it
you probably could also use a table, whatever you need
