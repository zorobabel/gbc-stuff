Assembly Fade Routine
Written by Paul Taylor

Here's one I knocked up. I figure it must be pretty naff, as it sometimes
makes the LED light of the Gameboy go dim :-\ and most faders don't do that.

Anyway, I thought I'd share it even if it is rubbish. Thanks for posting
yours Jeff, I may stop using my one though I'm blown if I can understand how
yours works. All I know is that I want one that's as nice as the one in
Mario Golf!

My code fades only the tile palettes (probably easily changed). It fades up
and down from an all-white palette. You point HL at the palette you want to
use. I designed it to be used in place of a straight LCD_ON/LCD_OFF, hence
it does that as part of the code.

Here it is, laugh at it by all means!!!
